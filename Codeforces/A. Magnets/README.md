# A. Magnets

__link:[A. Magnets](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/344/A)__ 

## Problem -> 
Regular magnet properites (like pole repel each other and unlike pole attract each other).

## Output ->
Calculate the number of groups of magnets are formed.

## Thought process ->
Take a first input which we consider as a previous value. Then loop and take other values and compare if the current value is equal to the previous value. If the current value is not equal to previous value then we increase group by one.
