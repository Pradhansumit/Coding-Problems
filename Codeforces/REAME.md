# Codeforces

The folder contains my solutions to Codeforces problems.


## CodeForces Information
### Levels
A & B type problems normally based on normal patterns or math.

C is based on simpler algorithm like dp or greedy (but easy application).

D, E, & F are normally based on graphs and algorithm.

### Contest Difficult
Div. 1:
For the most experienced and skilled programmers, often containing the most complex and challenging problems.

Div. 2:
A step down in difficulty from Div. 1, typically involving problems that require a solid understanding of algorithms and data structures.

Div. 3:
Generally easier than Div. 2, designed for participants with a good grasp of basic programming concepts and algorithms.

Div. 4:
The easiest division, suitable for beginners and those just starting their competitive programming journey.

## Problem Levels on Codeforces

### **A & B**
- Usually **implementation-based** or basic applications of math, strings, arrays, or simple algorithms.
- Common in **Div. 2, 3, and 4** contests.
- Often solvable with straightforward logic in under ~15 minutes.

### **C**
- Often involves **simple applications** of algorithms such as **greedy, two-pointer, or basic DP**.
- Requires more careful analysis and slightly higher implementation skill.

### **D, E & F**
- More **algorithm-heavy**: graph theory, advanced DP, segment trees, binary search on answer, etc.
- Commonly appear in **Div. 1** contests and higher-end problems in **Div. 2**.
