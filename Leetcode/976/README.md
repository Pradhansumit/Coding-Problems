[976. Largest Perimeter Triangle](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-perimeter-triangle/description/)

**EASY**

Given an integer array nums, return the largest perimeter of a triangle with a non-zero area, formed from three of these lengths. If it is impossible to form any triangle of a non-zero area, return 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,1,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can form a triangle with three side lengths: 1, 2, and 2.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,1,10]
Output: 0
Explanation: 
You cannot use the side lengths 1, 1, and 2 to form a triangle.
You cannot use the side lengths 1, 1, and 10 to form a triangle.
You cannot use the side lengths 1, 2, and 10 to form a triangle.
As we cannot use any three side lengths to form a triangle of non-zero area, we return 0.
 

Constraints:

3 <= nums.length <= 104
1 <= nums[i] <= 106

### THOUGHT PROCESS
First rule to see if the perimeter can be formed is by looking the sides are bigger than sum of other two. If it can't be formed then no perimeter. Then all we have to do is check for the bigger perimeter.
